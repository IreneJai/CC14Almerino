    <h2>About Me & Objective</h2>
    <p>
        I am Irene Jahzara Almerino, a motivated and hardworking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student with a growing passion for technology and innovation. My interest in the IT field began during my senior high school years at STI College Baguio, where I took the TVL strand specializing in ICT – Mobile App and Web Development. Through this experience, I was introduced to basic programming concepts and system development, which sparked my curiosity about how technology can be used to solve real-world problems.
        <br><br>
        Currently, I am pursuing my IT degree at the University of the Cordilleras, where I continue to develop my technical knowledge and practical skills, particularly in web technologies and programming. Throughout my academic journey, I have learned the importance of discipline, adaptability, and strong work ethics. I value punctuality, effective communication, and teamwork, as I believe these qualities are essential in both academic and professional environments.
        <br><br>
        Although I do not yet have formal work experience, I am eager to gain hands-on exposure in the technology industry. I am continuously improving my skills in HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, and beginner-level C#, while striving to grow both personally and professionally. My objective is to apply my knowledge in real-world settings, contribute positively to team goals, and build a strong foundation for a successful career in information technology.
